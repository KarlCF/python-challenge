# Python

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

* Text Type: str
* Numeric Types: int, float, complex
* Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
* Mapping Type: dict
* Set Types: set, frozenset
* Boolean Type: bool
* Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview

Variables:

* Variables are containers for storing data values.
* Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

Variables in Python:

* Utilize lower_case_with_underscore (for convention purposes)
* Do not start the name of variables with numbers, otherwise they are allowed
* Special characters are not allowed, except for "_"
